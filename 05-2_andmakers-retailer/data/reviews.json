Matches my style perfectly. It is a win-win. My cat gets a home he loves and loves don’t have to suffer the eyesore of the typical pet bed."

My cat didn’t seem interested for the first week, but now he’s in there all the time. I mixed them with shelves to give him a place to jump and climb and hangout. Great purchase. Hard to find these in stock."
